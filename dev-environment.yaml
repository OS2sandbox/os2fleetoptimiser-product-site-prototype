# This manifest defines:
# - A Pod running Jekyll
# - A bind-mounted volume from the host system for sharing content with the container
# - SELinux relabeling to ensure Podman can access the bind mount securely

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: jekyll
  annotations:
    # This annotation is required by Podman to apply SELinux relabeling to the bind mount path.
    # It ensures the container can access the host directory securely under SELinux policies.
    # IMPORTANT: Update this path if you clone this repo and use a different local directory.
    io.containers.selinux.mount: "/home/jmk/Repositories/spectral-jekyll-theme"

    - name: jekyll-shared-spectral
      hostPath:
        path: /home/jmk/Repositories/spectral-jekyll-theme
        type: Directory
        # This tells Podman to apply a shared SELinux label to the directory.
        # Use "shared" if multiple containers need access to the same label.
        # Use "private" if you want isolation.

      # The command below tells Jekyll to merge _config.yml (main settings)
      # and _config.local.yml (local overrides) when serving the site.
      # This allows you to keep most settings in one file and override only what's needed for local dev.
